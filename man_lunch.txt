[EXAMPLES]

See the examples directory in the source code for examples. 

Here is a simple example of a lunch config file : 

  add_command("xeyes", title="local_xeyes")
  
  add_command("xeyes -geometry 300x400", title="remote_xeyes", user="johndoe", host="example.org")


[OPERATION]
Lunch can be run either as a master or a slave. If run as a master, it launches slaves. The slaves are responsible for launching child processes. 

The pid of the master is written to a file located in /tmp/lunch-master*.pid, where * varies depending on the lunch config file used to configure the master.
Use kill -2 $(cat lunch-master-*.pid) to kill the lunch masters on your system.

The lunch config file is written in the Python programming language, and must call the add_command function. See https://svn.sat.qc.ca/lunch for help and documentation.
