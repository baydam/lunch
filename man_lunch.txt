[OPERATION]
The lunch executable is called the lunch master. The lunch-slave executable is called the lunch slave. If run as a master, it launches slaves. The slaves are responsible for launching child processes. The master laucnhes slaves (via SSH or not) which, in turn, launch child processes.

The Lunch configuration file can be provided as a argument to the lunch executable. If not given, the Lunch master will look for the ~/.lunchrc file. If not found, lunch will print an error and exit. The lunch config file is written in the Python programming language, and must call the add_command function. 

The pid of the master is written to a file located in /var/tmp/lunch/master*.pid, where * varies depending on the lunch config file used to configure the master.
Here is how to kill every lunch master on your system :

  for f in /var/tmp/lunch/master-*.pid; do kill -15 $(cat $f); done

[EXAMPLES]

See the examples directory in the source code for examples.

Here is a simple example of a lunch config file :

  add_local_address("192.168.0.2") # will avoid using SSH on this address
  add_command("xeyes", title="local_xeyes")
  add_command("xeyes", title="local_xeyes", user="johndoe", host="192.168.0.2") # we will not use SSH for this one.
  add_command("xeyes -geometry 300x400", title="remote_xeyes", user="johndoe", host="example.org")
