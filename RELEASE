Version 0.3.4 - 2010-07-19

This release introduces critical bugfixes with stopping child processes. 
There is a new text view in the user interface that displays more information 
about the child processes.
    
    New features: 
        * Better message at shutdown time
        * Added a textview to show command details 
        * Storing the PID of the child 

    Bug fixes: 
        * #81: To kill a child, need to send the signal to the child, not the slave, otherwise, the slave crashes, and the child crashes with it.
        * Using SIGTERM, not SIGINT. 
        * #80: Make sure we log until the process is dead.
        * #78: Increase delay between each signal when stopping a process.
